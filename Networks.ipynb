    "There used to be a literal link between the two callers, an occupied circuit. Circuits had to be switched by a human operator. This system was inefficient, and led to the invention of packet switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packet switching allows for the original message to be divided into packets. Each packet could take a different path. A single connection could fail, but there are multiple redundant paths for packets to still arrive at their destination.\n",

    "Local area networks are networks contained with in a small area (home, office, restaurant). The LAN is protected by the firewall. Typical devices are computers and printers, routers and switches.\n",

    "The number system used is hexadecimal, or a shorthand version of binary. It is base 16, from 0 to 9 and A to F. 0 (HexDec) is 0000 (binary) and A is 1010.\n",

    "Converting binary to decimal is straightforward. Each spot, from right to left, represents 2 to the power of the index. So 8 bits would represent 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1. The binary number \"10011011\" can be converted to decimal adding the values from where a 1 can be found. So \"10011011\" in decimal is \"128+16+8+2+1\" or 155. Converting a number from decimal to binary is relatively simple. Take the starting number, like 225, and divide it by 2. If there is a remainder, add a 1 to the binary version and move one space left. Take the number that fit (so 112) and divide that by 2 as well. There is no remainder, so add a 0 and move another space left.\n",
    "*There is a simpler way, though.* Take the number, 225, and take the largest exponent that fits into 225, 128, and subtract. The 128 space becomes a 1, then take the difference, 97, and see if the next space to the right, 64, fits. It does, so subtract and add a 1 to the 64 space. If any space's number doesn't fit, add a 0 and skip. [bla](https://www.youtube.com)\n",

    "There are different network topologies. Buses and rings are not used anymore. Stars and extended stars are used. Stars utilize routers and switches.\n",

    "### Setting up the Router\n",
    "Setting up the router was fairly easy, but it required a bit of tinkering. The whole process consisted of factory resetting the router, setting up the network, resetting the login credentials, and configuring the network settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We (Mubaarik, Loc, and I) used a pencil to press the physical reset button. Once the reset sequence was complete we were able to connect to the router via ethernet and navigate to the router management UI. Setting up the network was quick and easy, but almost too quick and too easy, as we sped through the process without documenting anything. This just meant we had to navigate through the UI reset those settings. It was good practice, at least. We chose a new administrator name and password, and figured out that our WLAN was named incorrectly so we reconfigured that as well. The last bit of configuration was to disable 5 GHz on our router. Finally, to test the connection, we opted to connect to the router through Wi-Fi using our phones.\n",
